## Color palette

Some swatches from the [RosÃ© Pine theme](https://rosepinetheme.com/)'s Moon variant.

## Usage

For (my personal) use with Firefox/Chromium extensions or live wallpaper programs that allow displaying custom URLs/files in new tab pages/desktop wallpapers.

Users can either:

- Use this [Github Pages site](https://brickyblossom.github.io/startpage/) directly;
- [**recommended**] Clone/download this repo locally and use index.html as the file to load on every new tab page, or host the file yourself on another webpage. This of course allows changing the title and quick links to whatever you desire.

### For Firefox
If using [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/), remember to <u>**tick**</u> the "<u>**Set focus to the web page instead of the address bar**</u>" checkbox! It's not yet possible to have a clear address bar when loading New Tab Override, and this option will give focus to the page (and therefore the page's search bar) instead. If this is not set, users will have to manually select either the address bar or the page's search bar **every time a new tab is opened**.

### For Chromium
[Custom New Tab URL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia/related) will automatically select the address bar, allowing users to type directly into it.
